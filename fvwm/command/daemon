# is copied into the buffer with mouse selection and pasted from the buffer
# with mouse middle-click) with the clipboard (the keyboard-driven cut-paste
# buffer, in which text is copied into the buffer with Ctrl-c, cut with Ctrl-x,
# and pasted with Ctrl-v). Synchronizing these buffers is (generally) a good
# thing. See: http://www.nongnu.org/autocutsel

#   correspond to that of the current geophysical location.
