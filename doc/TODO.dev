#
# * Create a default root menu, if not operating under Crystal, to ensure easy
#   access to the FVWM shutdown and recipe reload operations. This should be
#   accessible via the bang-bar as well of course. For a sensible example
#   utilizing "zenity," see:
#   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/fvwm-scripts/config
# * Correct the current (massively bad) implementation of "groupable windows":
#   especially, for GiMP.
# * Consider providing support for "Nitrogen," a lightweight Feh-alternative
#   finding increasing favorability, online.
# * Improve FVWM-Crystal compatibility by integrating with FVWM-Crystal's
#   default terminal settings.
# * Improve robustness. Mimic "Daemonize" elsewhere, particularly for
#   "$[FLUVIOL_XTERM_COMMAND]" to ensure that program exists prior to running.
# * Extract configuration into a new "Fluvio.conf" file, to be loaded by this
#   file. Also, extricate the FVWM-Crystal section in a new file as well, since
#   its contents have no relation to the rest of this file and only bloat.
# * Produce a proper tarball distribution and accompanying makefile. That
#   makefile will, probably, just copy files to appropriate target paths.
# * Produce a proper ebuild and commit to the Sunrise overlay. 
# * Install a sensible window tiling policy.
# * Ensure the current date and time for the system is sensible: e.g., more
#   recent than the year 2000. Systems having improper dates will result in
#   wallpaper rotation failures, among other things. (If not sensible, print a
#   graphical warning and disable wallpaper rotation. "zenity" could be a sane
#   application for doing this; alternatively, what about the gtk2-perl
#   bindings?)
# * I like the name "Fluvio," but I don't like the "Fluvio." It has no
#   relation to FVWM. Rather, since the 'F' in FVWM is formally undefined, let
#   us select a name beginning with that. Indeed, grepping dict.org for 
#   "^f.+v", I find the following intriguing words:
#   - flammivomous (Vomiting flames, as a volcano.)
#   - fluvial (Belonging to rivers; growing or living in streams or ponds.)
#   - fovea (A slight depression or pit; a fossa.)
#   - fovilla (One of the fine granules contained in the protoplasm of a
#              pollen grain.)
#   These words could combine with "WM" so as to produce neologisms resembling:
#   - FlammiVWM.
#   - FluVialWM.
#   - FluviaWM.
#   - FoveaWM.
#   - FovillaWM.
#   I quite like FluVialWM, particularly as the former two components "Flu" and
#   "Vial" are words themselves. Here is a humorous alternative, so as to avoid
#   unpronouncable strings of consonants: "Fluvi-wima". Oh! Nice. I think I've
#   found it: "Fluvio-wima." "Fluvio-glacial" is a compound noun describing
#   water created by the melting of glaciers. Bloody nice. "Fluvio-wima!" Har.
#   Possibilities include:
#   - Fluvia-wima
#   - Fluvio-wima (or "Fluvio-WM")
#   - Fovea-wima
#   - Fovilla-wima
#   Fluvio-WM is particularly compelling, having both a unique subword ("Fluvio")
#   not yet branded by any other entity and environmental implications.
# * Automatically adjust keys according to whether or not Dvorak is the current
#   keymap. Inspect "xkb" at runtime to ascertain this. Then, define 26
#   environment variables $[A], $[B], ... $[Z] corresponding to these keys, and
#   assign them values according to whether or not Dvorak is the current keymap.
#   (Very nice, yes?)
# * Consider integrating with formal themes from http://box-look.org, such as
#   the very keen Lethe at:
#   http://www.box-look.org/content/show.php/Lethe?content=91022
# * Consider integrating with "notify-osd," a fantastic framework for OSD
#   display popularized under the Ubuntu distro.
# * Abstract /etc/zsh* into files under "Fluvio.zsh/"; then, open new Kuake
#   consoles against a custom ZDOT="./Fluvio.zsh/". Great idea!
# * Fantastic ideas at http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/sdeg/xfce_improvements.htm
#   for bringing non-KDE windowing managers up to the professional quality of
#   KDE: mostly, by obtaining non-KDE alternatives to commonplace KDE
#   applications. Sound recommendations, most of which are lightweight enough
#   to be specified as "suggestions" in the Fluvio exheres.
# * Integrate with "transset" for proper transparency, ala:
#   xcompmgr -c -t-5 -l-5 -r4.2 -o.55 -f &
#   transset .7
#   Wait. "transset" has been supplanted by "transset-df", according to recent
#   blog posts: e.g., "All one needs is to have X compiled with composite support
#   (USE="xcomposite" in Gentoo) and two small X applications
#       * xcompmgr — a lightweight compositing manager
#       * transset-df — an application with which one can select the desired
#         transparency levels (this is a patched/improved version of the original
#         X.org's transset)
#           Although xcompmgr does not have all the nifty effects as KDE or GNOME
#           or Compiz do, it does pack real transparent windows (as well as panels
#           etc.), basic shadows and a few more tricks."
# * Add folque support for KDE's "systemsettings" control panel. I believe
#   the GNOME equivalent is "gnome-control-center", though I don't appear to
#   have the latter installed.
